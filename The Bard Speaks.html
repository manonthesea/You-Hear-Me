    <h1>The Bard Speaks</h1>
    <pre>
The Bard speaks for a moment past.
His song and dance is a quick step, shuffle, and skip,
accent and emphasis added for subtle effect,
but that is then and this is now,
that rhapsody of spring for which I do not sing.
A scattered thought and hollow feel are the best I scratch,
but the words we share like pen on paper carry significance 
that the parsing machines will never catch.

In my awkward caesura and empty sayings,
a refreshing winter-gust of wind smacks
of the nuanced understanding when stepping out,
into the dark, and onto the front porch under backlit night,
where tingling pores of uncovered skin feel a spirit near;
there, in that space -- translucent breath 
unseen in any real, lasting, photogenic sense -- 
is life beyond measurement.

In his rambling coherence and my over-complicated nonsense,
poetry encodes the human ethos shared by lauded troubadour
and your vacuous anxiety-ridden acquaintance.
In the unsettled rhythms and rhymes of life,
far from the warm summer of our conception,
we find ourselves standing in the cold
yet alive with word.
