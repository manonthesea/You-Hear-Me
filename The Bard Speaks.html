    <h1>The Bard Speaks</h1>
    <pre>
<span class="line-number">1</span> The Bard speaks for a moment past.
<span class="line-number">2</span> His song and dance is a quick step, shuffle, and skip,
<span class="line-number">3</span> accent and emphasis added for subtle effect,
<span class="line-number">4</span> but that is then and this is now,
<span class="line-number">5</span> that rhapsody of spring for which I do not sing.
<span class="line-number">6</span> A scattered thought and hollow feel are the best I scratch,
<span class="line-number">7</span> but the words we share like pen on paper carry significance 
<span class="line-number">8</span> that the parsing machines will never catch.

<span class="line-number">9</span> In my awkward caesura and empty sayings,
<span class="line-number">10</span> a refreshing <a href="https://manonthesea.github.io/you-hear-me/Prey%20to%20the%20Weather.html">winter-gust</a>
 of wind smacks
<span class="line-number">11</span> of the nuanced understanding when stepping out,
<span class="line-number">12</span> into the dark, and onto the front porch under backlit night,
<span class="line-number">13</span> where tingling pores of uncovered skin feel a spirit near;
<span class="line-number">14</span> there, in that space -- translucent breath 
<span class="line-number">15</span> unseen in any real, lasting, photogenic sense -- 
<span class="line-number">16</span> is life beyond measurement.

<span class="line-number">17</span> In his rambling coherence and my over-complicated nonsense,
<span class="line-number">18</span> poetry encodes the human ethos shared by lauded troubadour
<span class="line-number">19</span> and your vacuous anxiety-ridden acquaintance.
<span class="line-number">20</span> In the unsettled rhythms and rhymes of life,
<span class="line-number">21</span> far from the warm summer of our conception,
<span class="line-number">22</span> we find ourselves standing in the cold
<span class="line-number">23</span> yet alive with word.
