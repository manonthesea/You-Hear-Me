    <h1>The Bard Speaks</h1>
    <pre>
<span class="line-number">1</span> In my heart, a rip,
<span class="line-number">2</span> a gnawing reminder of the past
<span class="line-number">3</span> that tugs at my spirit,
<span class="line-number">4</span> whispering tales of yore.

<span class="line-number">5</span> A silence falls,
<span class="line-number">6</span> heavy with unspoken words,
<span class="line-number">7</span> the air thick with dreams deferred,
<span class="line-number">8</span> of hopes shattered and mended.

<span class="line-number">9</span> I roam through memories,
<span class="line-number">10</span> tracing the paths I once walked,
<span class="line-number">11</span> where laughter echoed,
<span class="line-number">12</span> and joy danced in the sunlight.

<span class="line-number">13</span> Yet here I stand,
<span class="line-number">14</span> a bard with a fractured tune,
<span class="line-number">15</span> weaving words into the void,
<span class="line-number">16</span> searching for the harmony lost.

<span class="line-number">17</span> So listen close,
<span class="line-number">18</span> for the rip in my heart sings,
<span class="line-number">19</span> a melody of longing,
<span class="line-number">20</span> a song of the unforgotten.

<span class="line-number">21</span> In the echoes of silence,
<span class="line-number">22</span> in the spaces between breaths,
<span class="line-number">23</span> you’ll find the truth of my being,
<span class="line-number">24</span> the essence of the bard within.

<span class="line-number">25</span> So I’ll carry on,
<span class="line-number">26</span> with each step, each word,
<span class="line-number">27</span> stitching the rip in my heart
<span class="line-number">28</span> into a tapestry of life.

<span class="line-number">29</span> A tapestry woven with dreams,
<span class="line-number">30</span> hopes, and endless possibilities,
<span class="line-number">31</span> for in every rip, there lies
<span class="line-number">32</span> the chance to create anew.

<span class="line-number">33</span> In my heart, a rip,
<span class="line-number">34</span> but also a spark of light,
<span class="line-number">35</span> guiding me through the shadows,
<span class="line-number">36</span> toward the dawn of understanding.

<span class="line-number">37</span> And as the sun rises,
<span class="line-number">38</span> illuminating the path ahead,
<span class="line-number">39</span> I embrace the rip,
<span class="line-number">40</span> for it is part of my song.

<span class="line-number">41</span> A song that will echo,
<span class="line-number">42</span> in the hearts of those who listen,
<span class="line-number">43</span> a reminder that we are all
<span class="line-number">44</span> connected through our stories.

<span class="line-number">45</span> So here I stand,
<span class="line-number">46</span> a bard with a rip in my heart,
<span class="line-number">47</span> ready to share my song,
<span class="line-number">48</span> with the world once more.
