    <h1>The Bard Speaks</h1>

    <div class="poem-line">The Bard speaks for a moment past.</div>
    <div class="poem-line">His song and dance is a quick step, shuffle, and skip,</div>
    <div class="poem-line">accent and emphasis added for subtle effect,</div>
    <div class="poem-line">but that is then and this is now,</div>
    <div class="poem-line">that rhapsody of spring for which I do not sing.</div>
    <div class="poem-line">A scattered thought and hollow feel are the best I scratch,</div>
    <div class="poem-line">but the words we share like pen on paper carry significance</div>
    <div class="poem-line">that the parsing machines will never catch.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="poem-line">In my awkward caesura and empty sayings,</div>
    <div class="poem-line">a refreshing winter-gust of wind smacks</div>
    <div class="poem-line">of the nuanced understanding when stepping out,</div>
    <div class="poem-line">into the dark, and onto the front porch under backlit night,</div>
    <div class="poem-line">where tingling pores of uncovered skin feel a spirit near;</div>
    <div class="poem-line">there, in that space -- translucent breath</div>
    <div class="poem-line">unseen in any real, lasting, photogenic sense --</div>
    <div class="poem-line">is life beyond measurement.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="poem-line">In his rambling coherence and my over-complicated nonsense,</div>
    <div class="poem-line">poetry encodes the human ethos shared by lauded troubadour</div>
    <div class="poem-line">and your vacuous anxiety-ridden acquaintance.</div>
    <div class="poem-line">In the unsettled rhythms and rhymes of life,</div>
    <div class="poem-line">far from the warm summer of our conception,</div>
    <div class="poem-line">we find ourselves standing in the cold</div>
    <div class="poem-line">yet alive with word.</div>
