    <h1>The Bard Speaks</h1>
    <div class="poem">
        The Bard speaks for a moment past.<br>
        His song and dance is a quick step, shuffle, and skip,<br>
        accent and emphasis added for subtle effect,<br>
        but that is then and this is now,<br>
        that rhapsody of spring for which I do not sing.<br>
        A scattered thought and hollow feel are the best I scratch,<br>
        but the words we share like pen on paper carry significance <br>
        that the parsing machines will never catch.<br><br>

        In my awkward caesura and empty sayings,<br>
        a refreshing winter-gust of wind smacks<br>
        of the nuanced understanding when stepping out,<br>
        into the dark, and onto the front porch under backlit night,<br>
        where tingling pores of uncovered skin feel a spirit near;<br>
        there, in that space -- translucent breath <br>
        unseen in any real, lasting, photogenic sense -- <br>
        is life beyond measurement.<br><br>

        In his rambling coherence and my over-complicated nonsense,<br>
        poetry encodes the human ethos shared by lauded troubadour<br>
        and your vacuous anxiety-ridden acquaintance.<br>
        In the unsettled rhythms and rhymes of life,<br>
        far from the warm summer of our conception,<br>
        we find ourselves standing in the cold<br>
        yet alive with word.<br><br>
