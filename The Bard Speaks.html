    <h1>The Bard Speaks</h1>
    <pre>
    <p>The Bard speaks for a moment past.<br>
    His song and dance is a quick step, shuffle, and skip,<br>
    accent and emphasis added for subtle effect,<br>
    but that is then and this is now,<br>
    that rhapsody of spring for which I do not sing.<br>
    A scattered thought and hollow feel are the best I scratch,<br>
    but the words we share like pen on paper carry significance <br>
    that the parsing machines will never catch.</p>

    <p>In my awkward caesura and empty sayings,<br>
    a refreshing winter-gust of wind smacks<br>
    of the nuanced understanding when stepping out,<br>
    into the dark, and onto the front porch under backlit night,<br>
    where tingling pores of uncovered skin feel a spirit near;<br>
    there, in that space -- translucent breath <br>
    unseen in any real, lasting, photogenic sense -- <br>
    is life beyond measurement.</p>

    <p>In his rambling coherence and my over-complicated nonsense,<br>
    poetry encodes the human ethos shared by lauded troubadour<br>
    and your vacuous anxiety-ridden acquaintance.<br>
    In the unsettled rhythms and rhymes of life,<br>
    far from the warm summer of our conception,<br>
    we find ourselves standing in the cold<br>
    yet alive with word.</p>
