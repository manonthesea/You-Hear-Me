<h1>Inside a Fish’s Belly</h1>

<pre><code>We slept outside on the open ground one summer last century. 
After a day advertised with fish jumping into our boats, 
no trout were taking any bait.
At almost a mile high, 
the sun’s heat pushed up just below the century mark.
I remember my white thighs burning red
atop that tin boat just staring at that glass water.   
I suspect it was the first day the planet started warming for good. 

Crane Prairie Reservoir ties time and memory together 
like an improved clinch knot: 
that season is a line threaded through the eye of my mind’s hook. 
As of late, whenever the sun is high and the air is thin, 
the burning white of my high thigh pulls on the line.
The white peaks years later appear in my memories
like I’m harvesting dragonfly nymphs today from beneath logs
along the nearly algae-free water of the shoreline.

Like a swallowed hook inside a fish’s belly, thinking of time past, 
what is remembered hides a point. 
A nose under the stars, upon anthills, 
and preyed upon by an infinite multitude of mosquitoes,
half-drunken fathers and their sons sleep,
only after taking whatever was in Dad’s pocket.
As much as it took to fall asleep lakeside on that mountain,
the more it takes it to turn back time and experience it again.</code></pre>
