<h1>Inside a Fish’s Belly</h1>
</pre>
<span class="line-number">1</span>We slept outside on the open ground one summer last century. 
<span class="line-number">2</span>After a day advertised with fish jumping into our boats, 
<span class="line-number">3</span>no trout were taking any bait.
<span class="line-number">4</span>At almost a mile high, 
<span class="line-number">5</span><a href="Muddled Soup.html">the sun’s heat</a> pushed up just below the century mark.
<span class="line-number">6</span>I remember my white thighs burning red
<span class="line-number">7</span>atop that tin boat just staring at that glass water.   
<span class="line-number">8</span>I suspect it was the first day the planet started warming for good. 

<span class="line-number">9</span><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Crane+Prairie+Reservoir/@43.7822694,-121.7959976,13z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x54c75db1d783bc4b:0x4e014cc2e66ec43a!8m2!3d43.7816802!4d-121.8040683!16s%2Fm%2F0g5pt0j?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank">Crane Prairie Reservoir</a> ties time and memory together 
<span class="line-number">10</span>like an improved clinch knot: 
<span class="line-number">11</span>that season is a line threaded through the eye of my mind’s hook. 
<span class="line-number">12</span>As of late, whenever the sun is high and the air is thin, 
<span class="line-number">13</span>the burning white of my high thigh pulls on the line.
<span class="line-number">14</span>The white peaks years later appear in my memories
<span class="line-number">15</span>like I’m harvesting dragonfly nymphs today from beneath logs
<span class="line-number">16</span>along the nearly algae-free water of the shoreline.

<span class="line-number">17</span>Like a swallowed hook inside a fish’s belly, thinking of time past, 
<span class="line-number">18</span>what is remembered hides a point. 
<span class="line-number">19</span>A nose under the stars, upon anthills, 
<span class="line-number">20</span>and preyed upon by an infinite multitude of mosquitoes,
<span class="line-number">21</span>half-drunken fathers and their sons sleep,
<span class="line-number">22</span>only after taking whatever was in Dad’s pocket.
<span class="line-number">23</span>As much as it took to fall asleep lakeside on that mountain,
<span class="line-number">24</span>the more it takes it to turn back time and experience it again.</code></pre>
