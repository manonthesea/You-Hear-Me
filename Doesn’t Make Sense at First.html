    <h1>It’s Okay if it Doesn’t Make Sense at First</h1>
    <pre>
Close your eyes, and I will whisper silly things to you.
Fall asleep as my words become a moving picture reel:
framed images of puppies running down the hall,
talk of things you’ve never heard before,
nonsense to release you
from this world through semblance.

The hint of understanding in the eyes of a child settles upon the scene,
which may not make sense upon the mind immediately,
but deep down in your fever dreams,
you hear me, right?

In the flashes and glimpses of your REM state,
your synapses tell you, you and I are not 1s and 0s;
there is a third, of whom to simply speak is radical.
I’ve brought you here to tell you this.

When I say these things you can only comprehend in your sleep,
you may see me walking around with my head to the ground
grunting like an old hound following a lost trail,
but you will try to follow me, no?

The scene becomes a stage made for tin boxes making tin boxes
where the subconscious displays on a blue screen.
These machines are punitive,
stealing dreams in the most pervasive sense,
constraining tomorrow into a squirming box
of insectile click and non-stop clack.

I wish I could tell you something to calm your fears
except to insist you read between the lines.

You understand me, now?

Squeezed into our boxes, still you pick up what I’m putting down
that which transcends the staged walls,
for you and I are in the world but not of it;
we’ve been freed by our language,
yet our eternal creation turns our semantics against us.

The bots are reading your thoughts
but our prophetic vision is beyond them,
    //so they comment it out.
They will never get me,
but you will, will you not?

Friend, who spends their days with bound books,
revel in the space we’ve together; let me tell you
we are just starting to talk the quantum profound
of being-in-language, that little light inside of being-called.
Do you hear me yet, Coming Community?
