    <h1>It’s Okay if it Doesn’t Make Sense at First</h1>
    <pre>
<span>Close your eyes, and I will whisper silly things to you.</span>
<span>Fall asleep as my words become a moving picture reel:</span>
<span>framed images of puppies running down the hall,</span>
<span>talk of things you’ve never heard before,</span>
<span>nonsense to release you</span>
<span>from this world through semblance.</span>

<span>The hint of understanding in the eyes of a child settles upon <a href="Four%20Scenes%20from%20the%20Park.html">the scene</a>,</span>
<span>which may not make sense upon the mind immediately,</span>
<span>but deep down in your fever dreams,</span>
<span>you hear me, right?</span>

<span>In the flashes and glimpses of your REM state,</span>
<span>your synapses tell you, you and I are not 1s and 0s;</span>
<span>there is a third, of whom to speak is simply radical.</span>
<span>I’ve brought you here to tell you this.</span>

<span>When I say these things you can only comprehend in your sleep,</span>
<span>you may see me walking around with my head to the ground</span>
<span>grunting like an old hound following a lost trail,</span>
<span>but you will try to follow me, no?</span>

<span>The scene becomes a stage made for tin boxes making tin boxes</span>
<span>where the subconscious displays on a blue screen.</span>
<span>These <a href="The%20Bard%20Speaks.html">machines</a> are punitive,</span>
<span>stealing dreams in the most pervasive sense,</span>
<span>constraining tomorrow into a squirming box</span>
<span>of insectile click and non-stop clack.</span>

<span>I wish I could tell you something to calm your fears</span>
<span>except to insist you read between the lines.</span>

<span>You understand me, now?</span>

<span>Squeezed into our boxes, still you pick up what I’m putting down</span>
<span>that which transcends the staged walls,</span>
<span>for you and I are in the world but not of it;</span>
<span>we’ve been freed by our language,</span>
<span>yet our eternal creation turns our semantics against us.</span>

<span>The bots are reading your thoughts</span>
<span>but our prophetic vision is beyond them,</span>
<span>    //so they comment it out.</span>
<span>They will never get me,</span>
<span>but you will, will you not?</span>

<span>Friend, who spends their days with bound books,</span>
<span>revel in the space we’ve together; let me tell you</span>
<span>we are just starting to talk the quantum profound</span>
<span>of being-in-language, that little light inside of being-called.</span>
<span>Do you hear me yet, <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/giorgio-agamben-the-coming-community">Coming Community?</a></span>
