    <h1>It’s Okay if it Doesn’t Make Sense at First</h1>

    <p>Close your eyes, and I will whisper silly things to you.<br>
    Fall asleep as my words become a moving picture reel:<br>
    framed images of puppies running down the hall,<br>
    talk of things you’ve never heard before,<br>
    nonsense to release you<br>
    from this world through semblance.</p>

    <p>The hint of understanding in the eyes of a child settles upon <a href="Four Scenes from the Park.html">the scene</a>,<br>
    which may not make sense upon the mind immediately,<br>
    but deep down in your fever dreams,<br>
    you hear me, right?</p>

<p> . . . <p>

    <p>In the flashes and glimpses of your REM state,<br>
    your synapses tell you, you and I are not 1s and 0s;<br>
    there is a third, of whom to simply speak is radical.<br>
    I’ve brought you here to tell you this.</p>

    <p>When I say these things you can only comprehend in your sleep,<br>
    you may see me walking around with my head to the ground<br>
    grunting like an old hound following a lost trail,<br>
    but you will try to follow me, no?</p>

<p> . . . <p>

    <p>The scene becomes a stage made for tin boxes making tin boxes<br>
    where the subconscious displays on a blue screen.<br>
    These machines are punitive,<br>
    stealing dreams in the most pervasive sense,<br>
    constraining tomorrow into a squirming box<br>
    of insectile click and non-stop clack.</p>

    <p>I wish I could tell you something to calm your fears<br>
    except to insist you read between the lines.</p>

    <p>You understand me, now?</p>

<p> . . . <p>

    <p>Squeezed into our boxes, still you pick up what I’m putting down<br>
    that which transcends the staged walls,<br>
    for you and I are in the world but not of it;<br>
    we’ve been freed by our language,<br>
    yet our eternal creation turns our semantics against us.</p>

    <p>The bots are reading your thoughts<br>
    but our prophetic vision is beyond them,<br>
    <code>//so they comment it out.</code><br>
    They will never get me,<br>
    but you will, will you not?</p>

    <p>Friend, who spends their days with bound books,<br>
    revel in the space we’ve together; let me tell you<br>
    we are just starting to talk the quantum profound<br>
    of being-in-language, that little light inside of being-called.<br>
    Do you hear me yet, Coming Community?</p>
