    <h1>Shooting Marbles</h1>
    <pre>
<span class="line-number">1</span> My father is Peter Pan on acid,
<span class="line-number">2</span> the youngest of the Merry Pranksters, 
<span class="line-number">3</span> tagging along the return caravan west to California, 
<span class="line-number">4</span> making detours, spending nights on communes,
<span class="line-number">5</span> drinking mescaline soup,
<span class="line-number">6</span> sitting with “turn on, tune in, and drop out” gurus.

<span class="line-number">7</span> My father is my father, 
<span class="line-number">8</span> and despite never growing older,
<span class="line-number">9</span> time still passes in Neverland.
<span class="line-number">10</span> History is still made, 
<span class="line-number">11</span> sins are still had, 
<span class="line-number">12</span> and his are now mine.

<span class="line-number">13</span> But perhaps I could be comfortable 
<span class="line-number">14</span> in his Pan shoes 
<span class="line-number">15</span> even when he wakes,
<span class="line-number">16</span> kicks his toe, and screams
<span class="line-number">17</span> off to the cold work waiting for him
<span class="line-number">18</span> day in and day out;
<span class="line-number">19</span> by the time you see him again
<span class="line-number">20</span> warmed by a sixer
<span class="line-number">21</span> and the ferry dust of his delusions,
<span class="line-number">22</span> he is now all grins.

<span class="line-number">23</span> Perhaps I can be the best of this boy-man,
<span class="line-number">24</span> and wear a smile for the lost boys, 
<span class="line-number">25</span> stuck in disbelief
<span class="line-number">26</span> that time ever existed 
<span class="line-number">27</span> before now
<span class="line-number">28</span> when all that matters
<span class="line-number">29</span> is shooting marbles.
