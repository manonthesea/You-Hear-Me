    <h1>Scenes from the Park</h1>

    <h2>1.</h2>

    <p>Weeping willows acknowledge spring<br>
    with roots growing out their heads.<br>
    Cats laze in sunshine-yellow rays,<br>
    while birds lay bare on the grass.</p>

    <p>Guitars strum.<br>
    Papers burn,<br>
    people watch,<br>
    and heads turn.</p>

    <h2>2.</h2>

    <p>Upon the lawn,<br>
    boys play with themselves;<br>
    the dogs, they are,<br>
    running about.</p>

    <p>Scat, better run.<br>
    Hags fume like choice squares.<br>
    They refuse to listen anymore<br>
    to folksong singing in the park.</p>

    <h2>3.</h2>

    <p>Cruiser rolls past whistling<br>
    and ringing bells to demand<br>
    a commanding attention<br>
    with a uniformed look.</p>

    <p>As the rule of law rolls up,<br>
    the crowd dies down.<br>
    Being <a href="The%20Bard%20Speaks.html">Bob Dylan</a> exits stage left<br>
    as blue suits with cuffs enter center stage.</p>

    <h2>4.</h2>

    <p>After the smoke clears,<br>
    boys send kings to madness<br>
    with rebellion -- taking down<br>
    their pants to powers that be.</p>

    <p>Among the people<br>
    hardly scared with wild eyes,<br>
    the world is fresh<br>
    with new fancies of flesh.</p>
