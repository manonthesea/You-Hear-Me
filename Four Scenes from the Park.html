    <h1>Scenes from the Park</h1>

    <h2>1.</h2>
    <pre>
Weeping willows acknowledge spring
with roots growing out their heads.
Cats laze in sunshine-yellow rays,
while birds lay bare on the grass.

Guitars strum.
Papers burn,
people watch,
and heads turn.

    </pre>

    <h2>2.</h2>
    <pre>
Upon the lawn,
boys play with themselves;
the dogs, they are,
running about.

Scat, better run.
Hags fume like choice squares.
They refuse to listen anymore
to folksong singing in the park.

    </pre>

    <h2>3.</h2>
    <pre>
Cruiser rolls past whistling
and ringing bells to demand
a commanding attention
with a uniformed look.

As the rule of law rolls up,
the crowd dies down.
Being <a href="The%20Bard%20Speaks.html">Bob Dylan</a> exits stage left
as blue suits with cuffs enter center stage.

    </pre>

    <h2>4.</h2>
    <pre>
After the smoke clears,
boys send kings to madness
with rebellion -- taking down
their pants to powers that be.

Among the people
hardly scared with wild eyes,
the world is fresh
with new fancies of flesh.
