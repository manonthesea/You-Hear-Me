<h1>By the Numbers</h1>

<pre>
<span class="line-number">1</span> The first day of the second month during the second year of liberation, 
<span class="line-number">2</span> already the accounting of Numbers starts with conscripting men. 
<span class="line-number">3</span> Men made to fall in line and come forward. 
<span class="line-number">4</span> When their names are called, they stand for what?
<span class="line-number">5</span> Say nothing of the radicals made among them that day
<span class="line-number">6</span> choosing to change their name, kneel, and raise their fist in defiance. 

<span class="line-number">7</span> The record of yesteryear and internet news tomorrow 
<span class="line-number">8</span> says only one thing of those protesting slaughter for hire:
<span class="line-number">9</span> they are delivered, nonetheless, into death -- 
<span class="line-number">10</span> rounded up or pushed into the <a href="https://www.earthwidemoth.com/blog/2006/07/27/vitanza-seeing/"><span class="italic">pageus</span> borderlands</a>, always made to fight.
<span class="line-number">11</span> Intimidated, coerced not to speak, and put to labor when they refuse, 
<span class="line-number">12</span> again and again, the men of the <a href="Pageus Trip.html"><span class="italic">polis</span></a> run them down with dogs,
<span class="line-number">13</span> spraying them with fire hoses and forcibly shaving their heads.

<span class="line-number">14</span> No matter the victor, the women cry out 
<span class="line-number">15</span> to their God, the God of Love, the God who will give 
<span class="line-number">16</span> his only son as debt paid for every sin of every father.
<span class="line-number">17</span> Out of sight of the hands counting heads today and coins later this month,
<span class="line-number">18</span> made to drink bitter wine, hidden in cellars, 
<span class="line-number">19</span> voiceless in the history of God’s bloody will blinded to women fleeing with babes in tears – 
<span class="line-number">20</span> Black Madonnas will speak a grand final soliloquy – a new accounting
<span class="line-number">21</span> of those accused of sedition against God’s word   
<span class="line-number">22</span> and of the sacrificed sons they cannot save.
