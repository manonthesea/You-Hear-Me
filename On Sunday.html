<h1>On Sunday</h1>

<pre>
<span class="line-number">1</span> Church people meet around the country,
<span class="line-number">2</span> in the same dank, drab basements 
<span class="line-number">3</span> and little musty rooms of modesty.
<span class="line-number">4</span> The modest keep quiet a righteous idea
<span class="line-number">5</span> about a man who spoke up in defense of the poor, 
<span class="line-number">6</span> cried in front of his witnesses, and went to the cross, 
<span class="line-number">7</span> even though he could have been Barabbas 
<span class="line-number">8</span> (without stakes driven through his rope-burned wrists).

<span class="line-number">9</span> He would not have wept, been spat upon, 
<span class="line-number">10</span> and made wicked powerâ€™s temporary fool, 
<span class="line-number">11</span> sobbing out to unseen father as he suffocates, 
<span class="line-number">12</span> is stabbed, and dies in front of his mother.

        <span class="green-ellipsis"> . . . </span>

<span class="line-number">13</span> Hope walks into the room looking up 
<span class="line-number">14</span> through a turned down brow
<span class="line-number">15</span> and sees honesty raised on a modest cross.
<span class="line-number">16</span> The righteous idea of <span class="italic">love thy enemy</span> hangs 
<span class="line-number">17</span> on crudely forged iron nails sledged through hands,  
<span class="line-number">18</span> holding the visceral weight of man pulled chest under foot; 
<span class="line-number">19</span> carried away, washed by servant hands of no living word, 
<span class="line-number">20</span> in resistance to the gravity of death, Christ rises --
<span class="line-number">21</span> having chosen death to live through the Word 
<span class="line-number">22</span> that love, stewardship, and service reign.

<span class="line-number">23</span> Upon aluminum chairs in modest rooms,
<span class="line-number">24</span> a humbling spirit presides;
<span class="line-number">25</span> looking each other in the eye honestly,
<span class="line-number">26</span> the modest wonder if they too are <a href="Transcendent Meaning in a Flooded City.html">godforsaken</a>.
