<h1>SNAFU</h1>

<pre>
<span class="line-number">1</span> The signal is digging in, 
<span class="line-number">2</span> digging trenches until disjunction inherits 
<span class="line-number">3</span> a troglodyte world: <em class="superscript">1</em>
<span class="line-number">4</span> assimilation, successful metaphor, 
<span class="line-number">5</span> and repetitive repetition
<span class="line-number">6</span> breed forgetfulness, 
<span class="line-number">7</span> so much so, digging out 
<span class="line-number">8</span> makes an uneasy task of up
<span class="line-number">9</span> and meeting out the square.

<span class="line-number">10</span> There, cars circle, 
<span class="line-number">11</span> circle the suicide circle; 
<span class="line-number">12</span> standing at the intersection, 
<span class="line-number">13</span> actuality starts digging in.
<span class="line-number">14</span> World turns wholly upside down,
<span class="line-number">15</span> every situation, situation normal all fucked up, 
<span class="line-number">16</span> and separation sinks in beyond all recognition.

<span class="line-number">17</span> Pray God holds the women and children.
<span class="line-number">18</span> 25-thousand miles halve the Earth, 
<span class="line-number">19</span> dug in, literally disjunct,
<span class="line-number">20</span> with the lucky ones, 
<span class="line-number">21</span> not asleep, up and out 
<span class="line-number">22</span> among the dead,
<span class="line-number">23</span> where trees are torn from their beds
<span class="line-number">24</span> and sheets are strewn about 
<span class="line-number">25</span> over lying men’s heads:

    <span class="line-number">26</span> Mud knee deep in some places, 
    <span class="line-number">27</span> others deeper than one dared to venture, 
    <span class="line-number">28</span> crawling about in the muck,
    <span class="line-number">29</span> washed away by the runoff of the leaden rain.
    <span class="line-number">30</span> Only way to bear the monstrous horror of it all 
    <span class="line-number">31</span> was to look upward away the earthly reality . . . 
    <span class="line-number">32</span> existing from moment to moment, <em class="superscript">2</em>

    <p><em>1. Fussel, Paul. The Great War and Modern Memory. Oxford University Press, 1977. </em> 
    "The idea of 'the trenches' has been assimilated so successfully by metaphor and myth ('Georgian complacency died in the trenches') that it is not easy now to recover a feeling for the actualities. Entrenched, in an expression like entrenched power, has been a dead metaphor so long that we must bestir ourselves to recover its literal sense" (36).</p>

    <p><em>2. Sledge, E. B. With the Old Breed: at Peleliu and Okinawa. Presidio Press, 2010. </em>
    "The stench of death was overpowering. The only way I could bear the monstrous horror of it all was to look upward away from the earthly reality surrounding us, watch the leaden gray clouds go skudding over, and repeat over and over to myself that the situation was unreal—just a nightmare— that I would soon awake and find myself somewhere else. But the ever-present smell of death saturated my nostrils. It was there with every breath I took. I existed from moment to moment, sometimes thinking death would have been preferable" (273).</p>
